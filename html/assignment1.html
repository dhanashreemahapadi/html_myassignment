<p><u><b>Answer 1: </b></u>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the internet. It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Internet HTML documents are made up of the elements and the tags that format it for proper display on.</p><br>
<p><b><u>Answer 2: </b></u>We use HTML tags for placing the elements in the proper and appropriate format. Tags use the symbols < and > to set them apart from the HTML content.The HTML tags need not be closed always. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags are not required as <img> tag.</p><br>
<p><u><b>Answer 3: </b></u>Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should be displayed.We add attributes right after the name of the HTML tag, inside the brackets. We can only add the attributes to opening or self-closing tags, but never be in closing tags.</p><br>
<p><u><b>Answer 4: </b></u>We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:

    <ol><li>tag br - is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.</li>
    <li> p tag – This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.</li>
    <li>blockquote tag – This tag is used to define large quoted sections.</li></ol>
</p><br>
<p><u><b>Answer 5: </b></u>The list types in HTML are as below:

    <ul><li>Ordered list – The ordered list uses ol tag and displays elements in a numbered format.</li>
    <li>Unordered list – The unordered list uses ul tag and displays elements in a bulleted format.</li>
    <li>Definition list – The definition list uses dl, dt, dd tags and displays elements in definition form like in a dictionary.</li></ul></p><br>
    <p><u><b>Answer 6: </b></u>An element in HTML is a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.</p>
